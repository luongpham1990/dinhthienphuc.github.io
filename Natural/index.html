				<p>A renewable resource is one which can be used again and again. For example, soil, sunlight and water are renewable resources. However, in some circumstances, even water is not renewable easily.</p>

				<p>A non-renewable resource is a resource that does not grow and come back, or a resource that would take a very long time to come back. For example, coal is a non-renewable resource. When we use coal, there is less coal afterward. </p>

				<p>Most natural resources are limited. This means they will eventually run out. A perpetual resource has a never-ending supply. Some examples of perpetual resources include solar energy, tidal energy, and wind energy</p>

				<p>Some of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be recycled, and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material.</p>

				<p>All places have their own natural resources. When people do not have a certain resource they need, they can either replace it with another resource, or trade with another country to get the resource.</p>

				<p>People have sometimes fought to have them (for example, spices, water, arable land, gold, or petroleum).When people do not have some natural resources, their quality of life can get lower. So, we need to protect our resources from pollution.</p>

				<p>For example, when they can not get clean water, people may become ill; if there is not enough wood, trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time (deforestation); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of starvation.</p>

				<p>Renewable resources include crops, wind, hydroelectric power, fish, and sunlight. Many people carefully save their natural resources so others can use them in future.</p>
