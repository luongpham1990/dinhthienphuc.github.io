		<h3>Based on military helicopter headset designs</h3>
		<p>The design of the <a href='https://dinhthienphuc.github.io/Razer/index.html#1'> Razer BlackShark</a> was inspired by aviator headsets worn by attack helicopter pilots. They provide the same level of comfort needed to endure extended mission times and superior sound isolation for absolute command-clarity in the most frenzied situations.</p>

		<h3>Superior sound isolation for distraction-free gaming and music playback</h3>
		<p>With the circumaural design and leatherette sealant of the headset&rsquo;s ear cups, block out all unwanted, ambient noise and only hear the awesome, intense audio of your games and music for an outstanding headset experience.</p>

		<h3>Gaming on the go</h3>
		<p>The <a href='https://dinhthienphuc.github.io/Razer/index.html#1'>Razer BlackShark</a>&rsquo;s detachable boom microphone makes this a highly versatile headset, at home both at a gaming setup and out on the streets for a finest music playback.  Go from immersive gaming headset and smack-talking foes at your desktop to listening to your music out and about in seconds.  The combined audio/mic cable works with all portable audio/mobile/computing devices including the iPod, iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire, Android phones, Razer Blade, Macbook Pro, or today&rsquo;s newer Ultrabooks.</p>
		<p>The included audio/mic splitter extension cable lets you use the combined audio/mic capabilities of the <a href='https://dinhthienphuc.github.io/Razer/index.html#1'>Razer BlackShark</a> on computers that use separate 3.5mm ports for audio output and microphone input.</p>
